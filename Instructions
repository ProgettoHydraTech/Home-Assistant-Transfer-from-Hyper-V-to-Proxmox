Do Backup of your HA on Hyper-V

save it somewhere safe

Download Proxmox Virtual Enviroment

Flash it on a USB

Plug the USB in a Pc with an SSD/HDD formatted

set the correct boot sequence in your BIOS in order to make the boot from the USB

Follow the Steps to install PROXMOX VE
(I won't explain all the steps)
go to the IP on the screen on a different pc (obviously)

Go to the Shell (It will be opened a terminal/command window)

Copy the .qcow2 Link from this link: https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux

in the Shell write:
...
  wget THE_LINK_YOU_COPIED
...

a .xz file will be downloaded (xz is a compression standard)

to unzip the file you'll write
...
unxz THE_NAME_OF_THE_FILE [eg.: unxz haos_ova-11.4.qcow2.xz]

you can check writing ls: if the file shown is without the extention .xz it worked.

you can create the Virtual Machine following the steps shown in the video

after creating the virtual machine WITHOUT STARTING IT, you'll go to Shell again and write:
...
qm importdisk VM_ID THE_NAME_OF_THE_FILE_YOU_UNZIPPED_BEFORE local-lvm  [eg.: qm importdisk haos_ova-11.4.qcow2 local-vm]
